Lost is an imitation of the game zork


##How works


You are lost in the city and you have to find your new house.


You can move arround the map using ONLY lowercase.

You can use to move: n, e, s, w or north, east, south, west, also go north, go south, go west, go east.

There is a function that is printng all time what is in the room an then the user will not need to put look at the room he is.

 Also you can look items and directions.
 
 Now the user can use this commands: 
 
 Pick and drop items
 
 Equip and unequip to use some items 
 
 Put and get to put or get items from the box that is in the school
 
 Some door you will need a key to pass and in a wall you will need to take the ladder
 
 If the user puts inventory it will print the items that are there\n\n if you find the map you will be able to see the map of the city, you have to put m or map
 
 You don't need to look your room because there is a function that is printing all time the objects that are there
 
 To take the ticket of the cinema you have to pick the money, if you don't have the money you can't take the ticket. My zork have a easter egg that if the user realize that can take the box to the cinema will be able to pick the ticket without having the money.
