Lost is an imitation of the game zork


##How works


You are lost in the city and you have to find your new house.


You can move arround the map using ONLY lowercase.\n You can use to move: n, e, s, w or north, east, south, west, also go north, go south, go west, go east.


There will be doors in the map you can open and close some them using open and to close use the word close.


You can look what is in the room you are and int his directions
