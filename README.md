Lost is an imitation of the game zork


##How works


You are lost in the city and you have to find your new house.


You can move arround the map using ONLY lowercase.

You can use to move: n, e, s, w or north, east, south, west, also go north, go south, go west, go east.

There is a function that is printng all time what is in the room an then the user will not need to put look at the room he is.

 Also you can look items and directions.
 
 Now the user can use this commands: 
 
 Pick and drop items
 
 Equip and unequip to use some items 
 
 Put and get to put or get items from the box that is in the school
 
 Some door you will need a key to pass and in a wall you will need to take the ladder
 
 If the user puts inventory it will print the items that are there\n\n if you find the map you will be able to see the map of the city, you have to put m or map
 
 You don't need to look your room because there is a function that is printing all time the objects that are there
 
 To take the ticket of the cinema you have to pick the money, if you don't have the money you can't take the ticket. My zork have a easter egg that if the user realize that can take the box to the cinema will be able to pick the ticket without having the money.
 
Now all entities have a list and the program use kbhit.

Now I have implemented buy and sell, the commands to buy are: buy ____ from seller.  &&  sell ____ to seller

You start with 0$ and the npc of the shop gives you 20$. If you go another time to the shop and you have 0$ the seller gives you more money.

Now there is an enemy that is the thug when the fight begin the user can use: attack thug, kick thug this is the special attack that have 5 seconds of cooldown.

I implement the command "use" because when you are fighting you can use potion to heal you.

At the start there's a guy and if player put talk can talk with the guy.

Road to dinish the game:
You have to pick ladder and equip it. Then go to school, say pass south and go to the house 2 and pick wrench that increse your damage you go east and you will find shop, there you can buy potion for use at the fight. Finally you have to arrive to house 3 pick and equip key then open east door and win.
